# 0x06. Unittests in JS

In JavaScript, unit testing is a crucial practice in software development that involves testing individual units or components of your code in isolation to ensure they work as expected. There are several tools and libraries available for performing unit tests in JavaScript, with some of the most popular being:

1. **Mocha**: Mocha is a flexible and widely-used testing framework that provides a simple and descriptive syntax for writing tests. It works well for both asynchronous and synchronous code. It doesn't include assertions out of the box, so you often pair Mocha with assertion libraries like Chai.

1. **Jasmine**: Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework that provides a complete testing suite, including its own assertion library. It's known for its readability and expressive syntax, making tests more descriptive and human-readable.

1. **Jest**: Developed by Facebook, Jest is a popular testing framework that comes with built-in assertion libraries and tools for mocking and spying on functions. It's known for its zero-config setup and fast test execution.

1. **Chai**: Chai is an assertion library that works well with various testing frameworks. It offers different assertion styles, including should, expect, and assert, allowing developers to choose a syntax that suits their preferences.

1. **Sinon**: Sinon is a library for creating spies, mocks, and stubs in JavaScript. It's often used alongside testing frameworks to help isolate units of code and control their behavior during tests.
